# P1_Domiance_vs_Epistasis
## This repository contains codes for generating the mathematical models and plots for the manuscript "Dominance vs. epistasis: the biophysical origins and plasticity of genetic interactions within and between alleles"


The codes can be run in the order of : "1-Function.R", "2-Parameter_and_WT.R","3-Make_dataframe.R","4-Figure.R".
## 1-Function.R 
It contains the mathematical models involved in this project.

## 2-Parameter_and_WT.R
It contains the parameters applied to the models.

## 3-Make_dataframe.R
It contains all the codes to simulate and generate dataframes for plotting the data. This code also includes the fuctions and parameters defined in "Function.R" and "Parameter_and_WT.R" for a quick analysis. 

## 4-Figure.R
It contains all the code used to generate figures.
