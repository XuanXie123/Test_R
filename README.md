The codes can be run in the order of : "1-Function.R", "2-Parameter_and_WT.R","3-Make_dataframe.R","4-Figure.R".
## 1-Function.R 
It contains the mathematical models involved in this project.

## 2-Parameter_and_WT.R
It contains the parameters applied to the models.

## 3-Make_dataframe.R
It contains all the codes to simulate and generate dataframes for plotting the data. This code also includes the fuctions and parameters defined in "Function.R" and "Parameter_and_WT.R" for a quick analysis. 

## 4-Figure.R
It contains all the code used to generate figures. If you have successfully unzipped the "All_model.Rdata", you don't need to run "3-Make_dataframe.R" for waiting a long time to generate data. You can directly run "4-Figure.R" to generate pictures.
